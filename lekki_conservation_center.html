                <h1>Lekki Conservation Center</h1>
                Located in the middle of Lagos, this conservation center is home to abundant plants and wildlife and plays a vital role in preserving the region’s ecosystem. Sign up for a guided tour with transportation included, or you can just as easily hail a rideshare and make your own way there.
                Take a stroll through the swamp boardwalk and spot rare birds, monkeys, snakes, and crocodiles. The park is also home to the longest canopy walkway in Africa, offering 360-degree views from above the treetops. If you’re afraid of heights, fret not—crossing this suspended walkway is optional.
